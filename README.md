Python functions for calculating ISA 1976 values as a function of height.

The isa.py file contains three functions, getDensity(h), getTemperature(h) and getPressure(h). They each take the height above mean sea level in meters as argument, and returns values in SI units, i.e. getDensity returns the density in kg/mÂ³, getTemperature returns the temperature in K, and getPressure returns the pressure in Pa.
